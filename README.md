# Is the one child policy a success?
This interactive vizualization is born in 2015 within the context of a course of Prof. Marian Doerk named *Introduction to data visualization* of the *Fachhochschule Potsdam*. While students (such as I) were learning about visualization's theory, they had to practically apply the earned knowledge to a personal project. Its realisation included the whole creation process a data visualization project is used to:
- Conceptualization
- Research
- Data gathering
- Data cleaning
- Data investigation
- Data visualization
- Presentation
- Publication

### Version
0.0.0

### Development
The project is a javascript web visualization and is meant to be published as a website. It has been build with modern technologies such as BackboneJs, React, Stylus, etc.

### Tech
Following technologies are used in the project:
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Gulp] - the streaming build system
* [Backbone] - the provider of structure for web applications
* [RequireJs] - a javascript module loader
* [UnderscoreJs] - library of functional programming helpers
* [d3] - library for manipulating documents based on data
* [c3] - D3-based reusable chart library
* [ReactJs] - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* [jQuery] - duh

### Todo's
Actually, the data is gathered and the code project is configured. Still, there is a lot of work to do now:
- <s>Find the fact and charasteristics I want to focus on</s>
- <s>Find the way of presentation and exploration</s> (could be improved)
- Mockup and design the data vis. (missed step)
- <s>Code the data vis.</s>
- <s>Add labels, legends, descriptions and additional informations</s>
- Clean and prepare
- Publish
